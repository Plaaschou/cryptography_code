# Cryptography code
Implementation of some cryptography concepts seen in class.

## Codes implemented
- Caesar cipher
- Vigenère cipher

## TODO
- Finsih Vigenère
    - **Find key length** Find outliers with respect to the frequency when shifting letters
    - **Find key** Compare frequency of letters with english and french (switching from french to english should simply be a change of parameter :arrow_right: use dataframe `df_freq_letter`)
- Class-ify the code because it's cooler
- Add documentation in readme to explain the train of thought for each file

## Contributions
All contributions are welcome. My code can very much be improved, be it corrections, comments, code cleaning...etc.

If you are familiar with other programming languages, you are very welcome to send me your implemention of the concepts seen in class and I will post them in this repo.
